# mini-project-I
The repository with instructions for Mini-Project I in Data Bootcamp. 

During this mini-project, we will work with the API from [Transport of London](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/). The main goal of this project is to practice different HTTP request and extracting values from complex lists and nested dictionaries.

> #### Instruction
> Register for the API service to obtain for an **Application ID** and **Key**. We will have to append these values as parameters `app_id` and `app_key` into each URL when sending the request.

`?app_id={app_id}&app_key={app_key}` needs to be appended to every URL in all HTTP requests.

> #### Instruction
> Once you have your credentials ready, go to the file mini-project-I.ipynb and follow the instruction in there.
